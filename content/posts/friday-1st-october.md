# Team Topologies

I recently read the [Team Topologies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43572685-team-topologies) book, which I think was excellent. Specifically, for me, it did a great job of taking a lot of concepts around organising teams that I've seen startups and other fast moving companies use (i.e. a platform team as an internal product team) and formalised them into a framework.

While I don't think anything in the book itself was particularly novel, the authors did a terrific job in distilling and simplifying the knowledge, by describing the problem, the technique to remedy the issue and why it "works". 

An excellent "how to" guide for anyone in charge of a large (2+ development teams) software organisation, looking to help the company go faster and safer.
