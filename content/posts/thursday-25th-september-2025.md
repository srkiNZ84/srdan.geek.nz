# Small organised groups

Reading this Mastodon post about people and various size organisations:

Recently I have stopped caring about watching or keeping up with the non-local news (and to be honest even a lot of the
local news I have switched off of) as it all just seems irrelevant to my life.

I do remember that a lot of people went through a "rejection of news" in particular after the COVID lockdowns in New
Zealand. The theory was that after being glued to the TV hanging off every (rather tedious) update, we were all burnt
out and struggled to care anymore.

It feels like this is related because essentially we are getting to the point that there are so many people in the world
that it feels pointless to have an opinion about anything anymore. The usefulness of democracy diminishes as the
population grows.

It feels a bit cynical, thinking like this. As if I'm betraying a younger version of myself or have started down the
slippery slope into nihilism.

In a more positive sense, we can call it "controlling what you can control".
