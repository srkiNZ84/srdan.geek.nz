# Productivity

Recently I had a look at some of the projects that I have started and I realised that they all have to do with "personal
productivity". I have a CLI timer to make it easier to work in a Pomorodo Technique fashion as well as a DNS blocker to
block out distracting websites.

My reasoning for this seems to come down to remembering when I was at my "most productive" in my life and trying to
re-capture what the elements were at the time.

There are two periods that keep coming up:

* Most recently, the period after I was made redundant from Vend and started work at ClearPoint

* Further back, when I was completing my PostGraduate diploma at the University of Auckland

The elements from the more receny productivity stint at ClearPoint seem to be:

* Pomodoro Technique
* Paper notebook for prioritization between Pomodoros
* Use of "keyboard only" interfaces
* Preference of basic editors (i.e. Vim) over IDE's
* Single screen for focus

From the earlier stint, the elements seem to be:

* Preparing the night before, especially making sure to have food sorted for the day ahead
* Leaving the house early in the morning
* Committing to a certain number of hours and not leaving for home until complete
* Going to a place where everyone else is studying/working and making yourself visible
* Having a place to "store stuff" while on a break etc...

There is a focus on leaving the house as when I was home I tended to end up completing all types of chores that I
normally wouldn't care about as a way to procrastinate.


# What has changed and why?

I find myself using the mouse more than I would like (and receiving the expected carpal tunnel problems). Also, I find
myself feeling like I "have" to use an IDE these days (VS Code + Cursor) and even with "vim mode" it is not the same.
Also, I am using three screens a lot of the time now.

None of these feel like they have made me more productive, however, they also feel like "essential" things that I need
to work.

I guess the challenge and the reason I have so many personal productivity tool projects is that I am trying to capture
the same feeling of productivity in this next time of life.
