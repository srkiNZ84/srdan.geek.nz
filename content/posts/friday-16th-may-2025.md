# Currently Reading

I am currently reading the [https://yoshi389111.github.io/kinokobooks/soft_en/index.html](97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know)
that someone has linked to and it's not bad at all. Some really good snippets, some are a bit of a miss.

I am also trying to finish reading the [BHP book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54716652-black-hat-python), I have given up trying
to follow along with all of the code examples. I should really finish this one before picking up any new non-fiction books, but the 97
Things... is just so digestible.

On the "fiction" side of reading, I am reading [So Nude, So Dead](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24883453-so-nude-so-dead) and it is
pretty good so far. I have almost read all of the Hard Case crime/noir books from the [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/hard-case-crime-books)
and have really been enjoying them as a "not so serious" read.
