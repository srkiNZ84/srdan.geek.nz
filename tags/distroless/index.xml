 Docker Container image scanning
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#docker-container-image-scanning"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I wrote &lt;a href="https://clearpoint.digital/devops/patches-arent-just-for-pirates-%E2%98%A0-vulnerability-scanning-docker-images-with-coreos-clair-and-klar/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; talking about the state of container scanning as it became clear that container images were going to have to be patched and the process was going to have to be managed just the same as we do for Linux boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the question came up again at work after a colleague rightly balked at the integrated Azure Container Registry option (Azure Defender for ACR) &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/details/azure-defender/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;costing ~$0.44NZD every time you want to scan an image&lt;/a&gt;. As such, this post is an attempt to summarise the state of container scanning and the avaible options at time of writing, with a focus on open source solutions that are easy to use and integrate into CI.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
