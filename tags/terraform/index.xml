 Terraform and deduplication
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#terraform-and-deduplication"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the issues I hit today was Terraform not picking up that I had declared an IAM policy for the same SNS topic in two different places. In fact it took me a long time to figure out what was going on as Terraform decided to use one of the policies and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand why the changes I was making were not being reflected at plan/apply time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
