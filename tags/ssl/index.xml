&lt;p>So, recently I was tasked with trying to securely enable metrics collection from servers which did not have a
private/management IP, only a publicly routable IP address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was a challenge in that if we are going to expose metrics over the public internet, security becomes a much bigger
focus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it was tempting to rely on a single mechanism to restrict access (such as firewall rules to only allow connections
from the Prometheus server), experience has taught us that it&amp;rsquo;s much better to not assume that any single mechanism will
work all the time (see: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swiss Cheese Model&lt;/a>). Instead we should adopt
several security mecahnisms such that if a single one fails, others will pick it up (also called &amp;ldquo;Defence in Depth&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Generating CA and certificates with CFSSL</title><link>https://srdan.geek.nz/posts/thursday-14th-july-22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2022 12:08:24 +1200</pubDate><guid>https://srdan.geek.nz/posts/thursday-14th-july-22/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="generating-a-ca-and-signing-certificates-with-cfssl">

&lt;p>Recently I was trying to setup an example mutual TLS configuration between Prometheus (the server) and Node Exporter. In doing so I
used OpenSSL to generate a CA and certificates for Prometheus and then have the Node exporter trust any client
certificates signed by the CA.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
