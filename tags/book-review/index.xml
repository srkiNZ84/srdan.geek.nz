&lt;p>I recently read the &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43572685-team-topologies" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Team Topologies&lt;/a> book, which I think was excellent. Specifically, for me, it did a great job of taking a lot of concepts around organising teams that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen startups and other fast moving companies use (i.e. a platform team as an internal product team) and formalised them into a framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While I don&amp;rsquo;t think anything in the book itself was particularly novel, the authors did a terrific job in distilling and simplifying the knowledge, by describing the problem, the technique to remedy the issue and why it &amp;ldquo;works&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
