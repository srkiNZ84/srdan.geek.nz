This was good as a language introduction and allowed me to learn all the features of the language and how it worked under the hood. However, by itself I don&amp;rsquo;t really feel I got a massive amount from that course.
Then at some point (possibly through someone linking to it from the Go reddit) I came across the Learn Go with Tests book.</description></item></channel></rss>
