Link to heading Recently I read an article from the Uber engineering team about how they are using Bazel on their Go monorepo. This prompted me to take a look at Bazel and what it does differently to other build systems.
Bazel is an open source build and test tool that originally came from Google. The main reasons why you might want to use it instead of the plethora of other build/test tools out there is that is optimised to do dependency management between libraries and services/binaries, regardless of language or framework.</description></item></channel></rss>
