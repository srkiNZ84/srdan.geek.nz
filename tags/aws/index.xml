 Efficiency of Lambda languages

&lt;p>Today I read &lt;a href="https://xebia.com/blog/aws-lambda-benchmarking/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article&lt;/a> in which the author designs a (fairly)
simple system of Lambda functions and then proceeds to implement the system functions using different languages. I
believe that the aim of the &amp;ldquo;experiment&amp;rdquo; is to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>verify whether the choice of language makes a difference to the costs of the system&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if so, to what extent it makes a difference&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The languages compared are Scala, Python, Rust and TypeScript, mainly looking at the associated Lambda costs for
each system/language.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The rise of K8s for infrastructure management</title><link>https://srdan.geek.nz/posts/tuesday-28th-sept/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 22:01:55 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://srdan.geek.nz/posts/tuesday-28th-sept/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-rise-of-k8s-for-infrastructure-management">
 The rise of K8s for infrastructure management

 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading">&lt;/i>

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>One of the typically overlooked aspects of moving to microservice architecture in general (and specificallyK8s for the purposes of this article) is the fact that each service &amp;ldquo;owns&amp;rdquo; its own datastore. Unless constrained by costs, this means a fully managed datastore instance (e.g. RDS). Once we accept that the service owns and manages the creation, upgrades etc&amp;hellip; of its own datastore, it then becomes logical to store the &amp;ldquo;infrastructure code&amp;rdquo; for this next to the application code (i.e. in the same repository). This is good as it really gives the team responsible a sense of autonomy of their own infrastructure and, currently, likely looks like a bunch of Terraform files in a directory in version control, next to the application code.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
