&lt;p>So, recently I was tasked with trying to securely enable metrics collection from servers which did not have a
private/management IP, only a publicly routable IP address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was a challenge in that if we are going to expose metrics over the public internet, security becomes a much bigger
focus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it was tempting to rely on a single mechanism to restrict access (such as firewall rules to only allow connections
from the Prometheus server), experience has taught us that it&amp;rsquo;s much better to not assume that any single mechanism will
work all the time (see: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swiss Cheese Model&lt;/a>). Instead we should adopt
several security mecahnisms such that if a single one fails, others will pick it up (also called &amp;ldquo;Defence in Depth&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
