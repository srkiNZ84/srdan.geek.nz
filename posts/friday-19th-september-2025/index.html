  LLMs becoming boring

Boring is good Article basically summarising the current state of LLMs. There are so many
articles with this same topic and theme at the moment (personally I had my AI rant in a group chat :-D).
The main theme is that it seems that we are finally getting through the hype cycle with LLM based AI and what everyone
is finding is that the value seems to be in very specific/niche use cases (e.g. helping me with TypeScript syntax). The
use case for higher level code generation/problem solving seems to be spotty at best (at worst you have senior engineers
quietly dropping the technology due to the amount of AI &ldquo;slop&rdquo; that is produced)."><meta name=keywords content="blog,developer,personal"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="LLMs becoming boring, motivation and NZ banks"><meta name=twitter:description content="So, this post is a collection of three unrelated articles that I have read recently.

Article written by a home loan advisor talking about the new (historically speaking) craziness with NZ banks being
required to carry out due diligence on lenders to a crazy extent.</p><p>The guy talks about taking out cash instead of using your card at the pub if you&rsquo;re buying people beers in order to hide
it from your bank. I had a guy I worked with have a similar issue where he liked to pay for dinner when he was out with
his mates an then have them pay him back that the bank had an issue with when he was trying to get a loan. I really don&rsquo;t
know how we got to this situation as a country.</p><h1 id=motivation>Motivation

where the author really breaks down the mental state of anyone trying to do something that they don&rsquo;t &ldquo;want&rdquo; to do (but
know that they should do). I really liked it as well as the tips and trickts that came with it. It mirrors a lot of the
